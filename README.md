# free-games-claimer
Claims free games on
- [Epic Games Store](https://www.epicgames.com/store/free-games)
- [Amazon Prime Gaming](https://gaming.amazon.com)
- PRs welcome :)

## Setup
... should be the same on Windows/macOS/Linux:

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Clone/download this repository and `cd` into it in a terminal
3. Run `npm install && npx playwright install chromium`

This downloads Chromium (343 MB) to a cache in home ([doc](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers#managing-browser-binaries)).
If you are missing some dependencies for the browser on your system, you can use `sudo npx playwright install chromium --with-deps`.

## Usage
Both scripts start an automated Chromium instance, either with the browser GUI shown or hidden (*headless mode*).

Login has to be done in the browser. It's hard to automate since you usually need to enter some OTP (but you can select 'remember this device').
After login, the script will just continue, but you can also restart it.

If something goes wrong, use `PWDEBUG=1 node ...` to [inspect](https://playwright.dev/docs/inspector).

### Epic Games Store
Alternatives:
- Run `node epic-games` (browser window will open, [headless leads to captcha](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/2))
- Run with Docker (browser is hidden inside -> headless for host):
  - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  - `npm run docker:build`
  - `npm run docker:epic-games`
  - When you need to login, go to http://localhost:6080 with password `secret` (you can also connect with another VNC client)

### Amazon Prime Gaming
Run `node prime-gaming`

Runs headless. Run `node prime-gaming show` to show the GUI (to login).

Claiming the Amazon Games works, external Epic Games also work if the account is linked.
Keys for {Origin, GOG.com, Legacy Games} should be printed to the console and need to be redeemed manually at the URL printed to the terminal ([issue](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/5)).
A screenshot of the page with the code is saved to `data/screenshots` as well.

### Run periodically
Epic Games releases one (sometimes more) free game *every week*, but around christmas every day.
Prime Gaming has new games *every month*.

It is save to run both scripts every day.
If you can't use Docker for quasi-headless mode, you could run in a virtual machine, on a server, or you wake your PC at night to avoid being interrupted.

## History/DevLog
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

Tried [epicgames-freebies-claimer](https://github.com/Revadike/epicgames-freebies-claimer), but does not work anymore since epicgames introduced hcaptcha (see [issue](https://github.com/Revadike/epicgames-freebies-claimer/issues/172)).

Played around with puppeteer before, now trying newer https://playwright.dev which is pretty similar.
Playwright Inspector and `codegen` to generate scripts are nice, but failed to generate the right code for clicking a button in an iframe.

Added [main.spec.ts](https://github.com/vogler/epicgames-claimer/commit/e5ce7916ab6329cfc7134677c4d89c2b3fa3ba97#diff-d18d03e9c407a20e05fbf03cbd6f9299857740544fb6b50d6a70b9c6fbc35831) which was the test script generated by `npx playwright codegen` with manual fix for clicking buttons in the created iframe. Can be executed by `npx playwright test`. The test runner has options `--debug` and `--timeout` and can execute typescript which is nice. However, this only worked up to the button 'I Agree', and then showed an hcaptcha.

Added [main.captcha.js](https://github.com/vogler/epicgames-claimer/commit/e5ce7916ab6329cfc7134677c4d89c2b3fa3ba97#diff-d18d03e9c407a20e05fbf03cbd6f9299857740544fb6b50d6a70b9c6fbc35831) which uses beta of `playwright-extra@next` and `@extra/recaptcha@next` (from [comment on puppeteer-extra](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/pull/303#issuecomment-775277480)).
However, `playwright-extra` seems to be old and missing `:has-text` selector (fixed [here](https://github.com/vogler/epicgames-claimer/commit/ba97a0e840b65f4476cca18e28d8461b0c703420)) and `page.frameLocator`, so the script did not run without adjustments.
Also, solving via [2captcha](https://2captcha.com?from=13225256) is a paid service which takes time and may be unreliable.
<!-- Alternative: https://anti-captcha.com -->

Added [main.stealth.js](https://github.com/vogler/epicgames-claimer/commit/64d0ba8ce71baec3947d1b64acd567befcb39340#diff-f70d3bd29df4a343f11062a97063953173491ce30fe34f69a0fc52517adbf342) which uses the stealth plugin without `playwright-extra` wrapper but up-to-date `playwright` (from [comment](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/issues/454#issuecomment-917437212)).
The listed evasions are enough to not show an hcaptcha. Script claimed game successfully in non-headless mode.

Removed `main.captcha.js`.
Using Playwright Test (`main.spec.ts`) instead of Library (`main.stealth.js`) has the advantage of free CLI like `--debug` and `--timeout`.
<!-- TODO: check if stealth plugin can be setup with `contextOptions` ([doc](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration#more-browser-and-context-options)). -->

Button selectors should preferably use text in order to be more stable against changes in the DOM.

Renamed repository from epicgames-claimer to free-games-claimer since a script for Amazon Prime Gaming was also added. Removed all old scripts in favor of just `epic-games.js` and `prime-gaming.js`.

epic games: `headless` mode gets hcaptcha challenge. More details/references in [issue](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/2).
